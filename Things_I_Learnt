Difference between

[1] contract CounterTest is Test{}
[2] Counter public counter; 
[3] counter = new Counter();

(1) This is creating a child contract, that inherits from the parent "Test"
(1) It inherits, public methods and properties, internal methods and properties, external has to be called via "this", does not get access to private methods and properties.

(2) This is declaring a variable that can hold address of type "Counter"

(3) This is deploying another contract, whose address is stored into the "counter" variable declared earlier. It gives access to public, and external functions.

Foundry Flags

--mt [--match-test] "Tells foundry to run only those tests, that match the test function's name. ```forge --mt functionNamewithBrackets```

Stateless fuzzing: random inputs, fresh state each time

Stateful fuzzing: random sequences, same state carried forward

A global invariant is a property that must always hold true for the entire contract/system, no matter what sequence of actions occurs.

-----

Stateful fuzzing: Ending state of previous fuzz run is the starting state of the next fuzz run.

Run a single test file
forge test --mp test/Counter.t.sol

-----

public state variables are actually exposed as getter functions. That’s why you need parentheses in assertEq.
