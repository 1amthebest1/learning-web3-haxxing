[1] contract CounterTest is Test{}
[2] Counter public counter; 
[3] counter = new Counter();

(1) This is creating a child contract, that inherits from the parent "Test"
(1) It inherits, public methods and properties, internal methods and properties, external has to be called via "this", does not get access to private methods and properties.

(2) This is declaring a variable that can hold address of type "Counter"

(3) This is deploying another contract, whose address is stored into the "counter" variable declared earlier. It gives access to public, and external functions.
