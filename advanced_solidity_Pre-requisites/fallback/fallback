Solidity smart contracts will reject by default the ETH sent to them.
--

--
There are two functions, Fallback(), and Recieve(), they can be made external payable via

fallback() external payable {}
recieve() external payable {}

			is msg.data empty?

			  /        \
			 /	    \
			yes	    no
		       /	      \
		      /		    fallback()
	            recieve()?
	            /       \
		   /         \
		  yes         no
		 /             \
		recieve()      fallback()

if fallback is not payable, it will not be called on the absence of recieve function.

Without these, the smart contract cannot recieve native eth. Solidity will compile this contract to reject any ETH sent to it.
