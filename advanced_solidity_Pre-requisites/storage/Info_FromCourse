All smart contracts have this thing called storage, everytime you create a state variable, it creates a storage slot for that variable.

uint public number1
uint public number2

This takes 2 storage slots.
---

Constant variable will not show up in storage, because its actually stored in contract byte-code.

uint public constant number3 = 4;

--
you can think of storage as a big giant array of variables we create.

just like an array the next storage variable will be stored in slot[1].

they got stored as hex in storage slots, hex of bool (true) is 0x0000...01

--

variables that are dynamic are stored in slots through some type of hashing function. Only the length of the array or mapping is stored in storage slot.

--

The variables declared inside a function body, only exist for the duration of function execution, they don't persist.

--

Why do we need memory keyword for strings?

Ans: Because strings are technically dynamically sized arrays.

--

Arrays and mappings can take up a lot of space, so solidity wants to know, if we are working with storage, or memory.
