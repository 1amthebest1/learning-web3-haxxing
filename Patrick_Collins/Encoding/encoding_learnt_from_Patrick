- this is how you concatenate strings?

- abi.encodePacked(string1, string2)

- we are encoding code into byte form

- abi.encodePacked() returns bytes object.

- basically we are converting bytes to string 0001100.. to "Strings, nice no?"

- in version greater than 0.8.12, you can do string.concat(stringA, stringB)

- What happens when we send a transaction?

- The binary data generated by the compiler gets put onto the blockchain.

---
---

- Transaction Fields.

=> Nonce
=> Gas Price
=> Gas Limit
=> To
=> Value
=> Data
=> v, r, s

---
---

- The transactions that deploy a smart contract:

=> Nonce
=> Gas Price
=> Gas Limit
=> To : Empty
=> Value
=> Data: contract byte-code, and initialization
=> v, r, s

The EVM reads the hex byte code, by seeing which op-code there is and does that. see [evm.codes]

---

being able to read these op-codes is sometimes abstractly called as the EVM. 

---

polygon, avalance, and ethereum all have the same readers [interpreters] for the OP-code.

---

abi.encodePacked() is a non-standard way to encode stuff to binary form the EVM understands.

---


returns(bytes memory) // returns a bytes object.


---

when we say, "oh what is the abi and all that, and we see arrays etc in compilationDetails/, that's basically the human readable version of the ABI, but in reality its
application Binary interface."

---

The difference b/w encode and encodePacked is that encodePacked compresses the binary, by not adding the un-used leading 0x00000..., this behaviour allows to save gas.

---

even though bytes(), and encodePacked() might give the same output, they are doing something a little bit different behind the scenes which can be found in 
[forum.openzeppelin.com/..]

---

abi.decode requires that:

the type you decode must exactly match the type that was encoded.

---

(string memory some, string memory nothing) = abi.decode(multiencode(), (string, string));

this line assumes that multiencode returns two strings, and puts one into each.

abi.decode() cannot decode packed encoding.

---

packed encoding is similar to type-casting.

---

Function Call Transaction:

=> nonce
=> gas price
=> gas limit
=> To: address the tx is sent to.
=> Data: what to sent to the address.
=> v, r, s.

--- 

call: How we call functions to change the state of the blockchain.
staticcall: This is how (at low level) we do our view, and pure function calls

---

call has parameters, for gas price, limit, value, and more...[look into it].
