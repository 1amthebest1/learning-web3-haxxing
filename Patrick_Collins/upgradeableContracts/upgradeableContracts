Delegate = let someone else execute the work, but in my context.

delegatecall means:

“Run the code from another contract, but use MY storage, MY balance, and MY msg.sender.”

A proxy is a contract whose main job is NOT to hold logic, but to:

forward (relay) function calls to another contract (called the implementation or logic contract).

So instead of users calling the logic contract directly, they call the proxy.

User → Proxy → Implementation


The proxy:

stores data (state variables)

forwards function calls

returns results back to the user

Yul is inline assembly inside of solidity, and it allows you to write really low level code, close to the opcodes.

Skipping this now, due to lack of basics in proxy contracts, making it harder for me to understand [look how proxy contracts work].
