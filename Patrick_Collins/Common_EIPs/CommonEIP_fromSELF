1️⃣ EIP — Ethereum Improvement Proposal

An EIP is a design proposal for:

Core protocol changes

New features

Standards

Best practices

Think of EIPs like RFCs for Ethereum (same idea as internet standards).

They answer:

“How should Ethereum evolve or behave?”

Types of EIPs

There are three main categories:

Core EIPs
Change how Ethereum itself works
Example:

EIP-1559 → changed gas fees & introduced burn mechanism


----

ERC: Ethereum Request For Comments.

An ERC is just a subtype of EIP that defines standards for smart contracts.

They answer:

“How should smart contracts behave so all apps can understand them?”

ERCs mainly define:

Function names

Events

Return values

Rules

So wallets, dApps, and exchanges can work with them consistently.
