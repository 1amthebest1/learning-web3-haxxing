You basically do a fork of the mainnet, via an API key etc, from a node like, alchemy.

forge --fork-url $MAINNET_URL

--

You can also do it in your test contracts, in the setUp() function via

	vm.createSelectFork({blockNumber: someBlockNumber(int), urlOrAlias: ""})

--

You can do it in your foundry.toml as well, via the syntax

[rpc_endpoints]
mainnet = "{GLOBAL_VA}"

in test you can do it then

vm.createSelectFork({blockNumber: 0, urlOrAlias: "mainnet"})

and if you do forge test, the test will automatically run a fork.
