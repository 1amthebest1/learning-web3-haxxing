- forge test

A test is fuzzed if and only if it has one or more parameters.

The testFuzz_ prefix is just:

a convention

for readability

for filtering with --mt testFuzz
---

To write stateful fuzzing you need to "import {StdInvariant} from "forge-std/StdInvariant.sol", and then inheret in the test

Then you add "targetContract(address(exampleContract))" in setUp().

---

Your functions should have the syntax " invariant_(functionName) ", basically invariant keyword before function name.

---

The thing is forge fuzzez your function by itself, and after each fuzz calls your function to verify the assert is correct.

---

Foundry does random fuzzing, to random functions by itself.
